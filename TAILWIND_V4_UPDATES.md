# Tailwind CSS v4 Updates

## Summary of Changes

### 1. CSS Import Update
- Changed from `@tailwind` directives to `@import "tailwindcss"`
- Updated to use the new v4 import syntax

### 2. Gradient Utilities
- Updated all gradient classes from v3 syntax to v4:
  - `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600` → `bg-linear-to-r bg-linear-from-blue-600 bg-linear-to-purple-600`
  - `bg-gradient-to-br from-*` → `bg-linear-to-br bg-linear-from-*`
  - Added new radial gradients: `bg-radial bg-radial-from-* bg-radial-to-*`

### 3. Opacity Utilities
- Changed `bg-opacity-70` to `bg-white/70` (using slash notation)

### 4. Animation Updates
- Fixed `ease-in-out` by using explicit cubic-bezier
- Added missing `slideDown` animation
- Added new custom animations:
  - `animate-float` - Floating effect for logo
  - `animate-pulse-glow` - Glowing pulse effect
  - `animate-shake` - Smooth shake for wrong answers
  - `animate-entrance` - Entrance animation with starting styles

### 5. New v4 Features Implemented

- `card-3d` - 3D card rotation on Question component

#### Starting Animations
